      <h1>What Makes Wine So Great</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Wine has been a popular beverage of mankind for thousands of years. Our natural fondness of this drink stems from the wonderful taste, its nutritious properties and not least its psychotropic (intoxicating) effects.
        Out of all alcoholic drinks, none has had such an impact on society. <br>
        The trade of wine between cultures opened up channels for religious and philosophical ideas to spread across Europe. Wine is also frequently mentioned in the bible from Noah
        and his grape vines to Jesus, as perhaps the finest winemaker to date.
        Wine is to this day used in the Catholic Church as a substitute for the blood of Christ, which is an indication of the key role the beverage has played in years gone by. Centuries ago, a wine industry was also the mark of a provident country,
        as only developed societies could support a prosperous and competitive wine industry. It is often said that western society built its foundations on wine.
        No one can be sure, but there is an ancient Persian fable that recognises a woman as the discoverer of wine.

    <h1>History Of Wine</h1>
    <hr>
    <img src="images/oldwine.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="images/oldwine1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The first sign of the wine we all know and love can be traced back to sixty-million-year-old fossils, which means our pre-human ancestors may well have come to realise older grapes will have been more desirable. We can also observe this with
      our animal friends today, who tend to prefer riper fruit.
      The earliest remnants of wine were discovered in the site of Hajji Firuz Tepe, in the northern Zagros Mountains of Iran. The wine dated back to the Neolithic period (8500-4000 B.C.). Carbon dating confirmed the wine was from sometime between
      5400-5000 B.C.
      Although wine dating any earlier than this has yet been found, it is thought the art of wine making started shortly after 6000 B.C. it is believed this is the date for one of mankind’s most momentous creations, because the people of these
      regions had managed to create permanent settlements via the domestication of animals and plants.
      Now we skip forward a few thousand years to the Predynastic era of the Egyptian Pharaohs, when wine was spreading across the ancient world. Hieroglyphics from this time show that perhaps binge drinking is not such a modern problem, as
      apparently the Pharaohs didn’t seem to care that much about the quality - but more on quantity.

  <div class="history-context2">
    <img src="images/oldwine2.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Monks (particularly Benedictine monks) spread the knowledge of wine even further, as wine was required for Holy Communion. The Church transported it all across Europe, spreading the “good news” as it were. <br>
      The only problem was, the wine they distributed was heavily watered down, as the Church didn’t take kindly to drunkenness (spoilsports). Eventually, the French aristocracy took on the task of winemaking alongside the church.
      By 1725, Bordeaux had already classified the finest red wines it produced but an official classification based on prices wasn’t created until as late as 1855. This classification divided the wines into up to 5 classes or crus.
      This all came to an abrupt end at the start of the French Revolution in 1789, by the end of which in 1799 the power was with people. More importantly though, so were the vineyards. The newly founded French Republic removed all feudal
      privileges that the Catholic Clergy and the nobles possessed. Any nobles who didn’t manage to flee also lost their heads

    <h1>Wine and War</h1>
    <img src="images/soldiersandwine.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Troops were originally rationed water but soon, they were given wine rations to help them get through their daily ordeal. French soldiers from different regions in France often found themselves living alongside people from other parts of the
      country in trenches for a considerable period. Through drinking wine, which many of them hadn’t done before, they discovered a shared culture and shared customs. Drinking wine was a way to gel with each other while on the battlefield and it’s
      very prevalent in the advertising of this period.</p>
    <p>Increasingly, wine became perceived as being acceptable (particularly when it was weaker than the liqueurs of old). Huge production and distribution networks sprang up to get supplies to the trenches, and campaigns were conducted to encourage
      citizens to conserve their wine for the war effort. When the war was over, wine continued to be consumed in the same way, distributed using the now fully-functioning transport links. It was by then, France’s national drink.
