    <h1>Brewing Process</h1>

  </div>
  <div class="brew">
    <p>Wine is in the same category of fermented liquor as sake and beer. Fermented beverages are alcoholic drinks made when yeast ferments alcohol from
      the agricultural crops used. That fermentation process differs for each type of drink, and a unique
      characteristic of wine is that it uses a sophisticated production method.

    <div class="first grapes">Veraison</div>
    <div class="first-p">
      <p>Veraison is the magical moment when those hard,
        green grapes transform into plump, juicy clusters. Veraison is especially noticeable in red grapes as the fruit turns from green to purple.
        In white grapes,like Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay, the clusters turn from bright green to a more mellow golden green.</p>

    <div class="first grapes">Harvesting</div>
    <div class="first-p">
      <p>Harvesting or picking is certainly the first step in the actual wine making process
        Fresh and fully ripened wine grapes are preferred as raw material for wine making.
        In cool climates,as in northern Europe and the eastern United States

    </div>
      <div class="first process">Crushing</div>
      <div class="first-p">
        <p>
          Crushing the whole clusters of fresh ripe grapes is traditionally the next step in the wine making process.
          Today, mechanical crushers perform the time-honored tradition of stomping or trodding the grapes into what is commonly referred to as must.
          For thousands of years,it was men and women who performed the harvest dance in barrels and presses that began grape juice's magical transformation

      </div>

      <div class="first process">Juice separation</div>
      <div class="first-p">
        <p>When the juice of white grapes is processed or a white wine is desired,
          the juice is usually separated from the skins and seeds immediately after crushing. Occasionally,
          to increase flavour extraction, the white skins may be allowed to remain in contact with the juice for 12 to 24 hours,
          but this procedure also increases colour extraction, sometimes undesirably.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="arrow"><i class="fas fa-arrow-down fa-2x"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="first process">Fermentation</div>
      <div class="first-p">
        <p>The process of alcoholic fermentation requires careful control for the production of high quality wines.
          Requirements include suppression of the growth of undesirable microorganisms, presence of adequate numbers of desirable yeasts,
          proper nutrition for yeast growth, temperature control for prevention of excessive heat,
          prevention of oxidation, and proper management of the cap of skins floating in red musts.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="arrow"><i class="fas fa-arrow-down fa-2x"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="first process">Filtering</div>
      <div class="first-p">
        <p>Filtration is another ancient practice, and early filters consisted of rough cloth-covered screens through which the wine was poured.
          Modern filter pads are made of cellulose fibres of various porosities or consist of membrane filters, also in a range of porosities.
          The pore size of some filters is sufficiently small to remove yeast cells and most bacterial cells,
          but filters operate not only because of pore size but also by a certain amount of adsorption.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="arrow"><i class="fas fa-arrow-down fa-2x"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="first process">Ageing</div>
      <div class="first-p">
        <p>Many wines improve in quality during barrel and bottle storage.
          Such wines eventually reach their peak and with further aging begin to decline. During the aging period,
          acidity decreases, additional clarification and stabilization occur as undesirable substances are precipitated,
          and the various components of the wine form complex compounds affecting flavour and aroma.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="arrow"><i class="fas fa-arrow-down fa-2x"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="first process">Bottling</div>
      <div class="first-p">
        <p>Before bottling, wine may require blending, filtration,
          and use of antiseptics to combat microbe development. Often several casks containing the same wine will develop differences during aging,
          and blending is desirable to ensure uniformity. Wines that are slightly deficient in colour or acid may be blended with special wines as a means of correction.
          Blending frequently improves quality by adding to the complexity of the wine.</p>
